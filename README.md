# EfficientPython
This is the repo contains an evolving open source book " Efficient Python for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering", which is aimed to cover topics from advanced python programming, advanced usage of python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit, Keras,  and Tensorflow etc., to cases studies of data science and machine learning application and software design and engineering in the Python framework.

The tentative chapters are
## Foundations of Programming and Computation in Python

### Pythonic Advanced Programming

### Efficient Numpy

### Efficient Pandas: Series

### Efficient Pandas: DataFrame

### Efficient Linear Algebra via Numpy and Scipy

### Mathematical Optimization via Scipy

## Data Science and Machine Learning Case Studies



### Python for Big Data Architecture
